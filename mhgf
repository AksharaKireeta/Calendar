The objective of this project is to build a calendar app integrated with ADPs HCM system via the marketplace platform.
Organizations using ADP’s HCM system will be able to use this calendar app to view employee’s work schedule and leave event details.
Also, the app will provide valuable insights to managers on employee’s well being and engagement based on their schedule and leave data.
The calendar app will get the required data from the SOR via marketplace APIs and display these details on the calendar.
